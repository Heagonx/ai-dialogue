english.kyodonews.net
 (standard national rate) and an admission fee ~¥282,000. Over 2 years, tuition+fees ≈ ¥1.35M. Living costs in Sendai (Tohoku’s city) are moderate: ~¥100k/month for rent and expenses, ~¥2.4M for 2 years. Total ~¥3.8–4M, comfortably under ¥300k CNY. (Note: UTokyo’s planned tuition hike doesn’t affect Tohoku yet; ¥535,800/year remains​
english.kyodonews.net
.)
Scholarship: None guaranteed. However, students may apply for JASSO scholarships (monthly stipend ~¥48,000) or Tohoku’s internal awards. The Asian Development Bank–Japan Scholarship may also cover Tohoku programs in certain fields (though more common in social/environment fields). These are competitive and not assumed in the budget. The difficulty of securing such scholarships is Moderate – many international students at Tohoku do get JASSO or partial tuition waivers, but not all; a GPA in the top 10% will help in these applications.
Field Coverage: Moderate/High – Tohoku is strong in optics and engineering (it’s known for its optical research – e.g. Tohoku’s Institute of Laser Engineering). The IMSE course can involve photonic material research, and other departments (Electrical Engineering, Applied Physics) also accept international students with English coursework​
tohoku.ac.jp
​
tohoku.ac.jp
. If the student’s interest is lasers/photonics, they can align their thesis under a relevant lab (even if the program title is Materials or Mechanical). The match is good, though not as tailored as a specific “Photonics” program.
Local Work Policies: Supportive – As with all Japanese universities, international graduates can stay in Japan for job hunting (Tohoku’s career center assists with job fairs, etc.). Many tech companies in Japan recruit from Tohoku University due to its strong engineering reputation. The Japanese government allows a Designated Activities visa for job search and is encouraging foreign STEM talent to work in Japan. Sendai itself has some tech industry, but most students move to larger cities (Tokyo, Osaka) for employment. Tohoku’s name and alumni network in the electronics/optics sector provide a pathway to those opportunities.
Kyushu University – Japan (QS Asia #34)​
en.ritsumei.ac.jp
Program: International Master’s Programs in Engineering. Kyushu offers English-taught master’s tracks in all 11 engineering departments​
isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp
 – for example, Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) or Applied Quantum Physics (which includes optical engineering). These International Courses run parallel to the Japanese courses, with coursework, research, and seminars all in English​

english.kyodonews.net
, plus ¥282k admission, totaling ~¥1.35M for 2 years. Fukuoka (city of Kyushu U) has a lower cost of living than Tokyo: ~¥80k–100k/month suffices for rent and living. Two-year living ~¥2.2M. Combined ≈ ¥3.6–3.8M (~CNY ¥180k–190k). This is well within ¥300k CNY.
Scholarship: None by default. Kyushu does not automatically waive tuition, but it does have tuition reduction schemes (up to 50% tuition exemption in the second year for students with outstanding grades or financial need) and access to external scholarships. The student could also apply for the MEXT Embassy Scholarship prior to admission (which, if obtained, would cover everything). Without those, the costs as above apply. The difficulty of getting additional funding is Medium – many Kyushu international students get some tuition waiver or stipends, but it’s not assured; a solid academic performance (the student’s top 10% class rank) would be advantageous in such petitions.
Field Coverage: High – Kyushu is a comprehensive engineering school with expertise in laser and optical engineering, electronics, and communications. For instance, its Applied Physics department researches laser fusion and photonic devices​
eng.kyushu-u.ac.jp
, and EECS covers optical networks and devices​
eng.kyushu-u.ac.jp
. The international courses mirror the Japanese curriculum​
isc.kyushu-u.ac.jp
, so the student will get a full spectrum of relevant courses (photonics, optical sensing, etc.) in English. The match to “optics, laser tech, EE, comm” is very strong across different departments (the student can pick the department that best fits their interest and will find ample photonics-related work).
Local Work Policies: Encouraging – Fukuoka is a growing tech hub in Japan (especially for startups and electronics). Kyushu University has a Office for Academic Jobs which helps connect students with employers. Japan’s work visa framework readily allows Kyushu grads to stay if hired. Many graduates find employment in local companies or in broader Japan (some high-tech manufacturing firms and telecom companies operate in Kyushu). Additionally, Fukuoka has a special economic zone promoting startups, and the city actively wants foreign talent. Therefore, staying in Japan after graduating from Kyushu is a realistic goal; the university and city provide a supportive environment (including some programs that assist international students in career development and visa guidance).
Nagoya University – Japan (QS Asia #32)​
en.ritsumei.ac.jp

Students can also consider the Physics and Mathematics program if leaning more theoretical, or Chemistry for photonic materials – all are in English.
Estimated Total Budget: ~JPY ¥4.5–5.0 million (≈ CNY ¥225k–250k). Nagoya is national, so tuition is ¥535,800/year​
english.kyodonews.net
, with ¥282k entrance fee (~¥1.35M total fees). Living in Nagoya costs around ¥100k–110k/month (cheaper than Tokyo but a bit above smaller cities). Two-year living ~¥2.5M. Total ~¥3.85M, ~CNY ¥192k. Even accounting for some higher personal expenses, it should stay under ¥300k CNY.
Scholarship: None upfront. Nagoya’s G30 programs do not guarantee funding, but exceptional applicants can be considered for university scholarships or JASSO stipends. There are also external scholarships targeting G30 international students (e.g. MEXT University Recommendation at Nagoya, although priority often goes to PhD). Generally, assume self-funded. Difficulty: Medium for getting any scholarship – Nagoya might offer a limited number of tuition waivers or partial awards to top candidates, but with a GPA 3.2/5 (about 64%), the student’s chances for those might be average (unless strong research experience compensates). The budget above assumes no scholarship.
Field Coverage: High – Nagoya University is renowned for its work in optical science and engineering (it’s the alma mater of Nobel laureates in blue LED technology). The Engineering Physics program specifically will cover state-of-the-art photonics, quantum engineering, and applied optics – an excellent fit for a laser-focused student. The curriculum and research opportunities in English allow the student to delve into laser engineering, optical materials, and communications technology. Nagoya’s faculty in electrical engineering and physics have many projects in photonics, so matching a thesis topic in lasers or optical circuits is very feasible.
Local Work Policies: Supportive – Nagoya is an industrial powerhouse (automotive and electronics companies like Toyota, DENSO have R&D there). Nagoya University’s career services help international students with job placements, and companies in the region do hire international grads (especially those with advanced engineering skills). The student can remain in Japan after graduation to work; many G30 graduates either continue to PhD or join industries. Given Japan’s acute need for high-tech engineers, a Nagoya grad in photonics/EE stands a good chance of securing employment (perhaps in manufacturing or tech development). The city of Nagoya, while not as large as Tokyo, has a significant expat community and industries that facilitate obtaining work visas for skilled graduates.
Waseda University – Japan (QS Asia #51)​
en.ritsumei.ac.jp
Program: English-based Graduate Program in Fundamental/Creative/Advanced Science and Engineering​
waseda.jp
. Waseda is a top private university that offers several Master’s programs fully in English, notably in its Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering. A relevant option is the Electronic and Photonic Systems field under the Department of Applied Physics or Electrical Engineering (exact program naming can vary). Essentially, Waseda allows international students to pursue an M.S. in areas like electronics, communications, or applied physics entirely in English​
waseda.jp
. The curriculum is similar to the Japanese program but with English lectures and thesis.
Estimated Total Budget: ~JPY ¥5.5–6.0 million (≈ CNY ¥275k–300k). Being private, Waseda’s tuition is higher: approximately ¥ ~0.9–1.0 million per year for science/engineering masters. For example, one year of an English-based Science & Engineering master’s is around JPY ¥900,000​
japantimes.co.jp
 (Waseda’s standard rate), plus an admission fee of ~¥200,000. Two-year tuition ~¥2M. Living in Tokyo for two years ~¥2.8–3M (¥120k/month average). Total roughly ¥5M (~CNY ¥250k). This stays within ¥300k CNY; however, there is less “cushion” here compared to national universities due to higher tuition.
Scholarship: None guaranteed. Waseda has some merit scholarships for international students (e.g. partial tuition reductions) and also honors external scholarships. The Japanese Government MEXT (Embassy) scholarship can be used at Waseda if obtained, and Waseda also participates in the China Scholarship Council program​
waseda.jp
 (if the student is Chinese, they could explore that). Without those, assume full self-funding. Difficulty: Medium to secure funding – Waseda might award, say, a 30% tuition waiver for a very strong applicant, but given the student’s credentials, it’s uncertain. Many students budget for full tuition and later apply for second-year reductions based on grades.
Field Coverage: High – Waseda’s English-based graduate courses span electronics, optics, information engineering and more​
waseda.jp
. The School of Advanced Sci & Eng has professors doing research in laser processing, photonic networks, optical materials, etc. The student’s interests in lasers and optical engineering would be well-supported, as Waseda has modern photonics labs (often in collaboration with industry). The program is flexible: one can take courses in communications engineering, semiconductor optics, laser physics, etc. Thus, the specialization matches well, even if the program name is broad (the student can tailor their thesis to photonics).
Local Work Policies: Very Good – Being in Tokyo, Waseda students have proximity to Japan’s biggest job market. Waseda’s reputation and extensive alumni network in companies and research institutions open doors for employment. The university often hosts career fairs with multinational and Japanese firms. International grads can convert to work visas once hired; Tokyo has many opportunities in electronics, telecom, and photonics (e.g. Canon, NTT, Hitachi all have R&D in optics). Waseda itself is very accustomed to guiding international students into the job market. The chances of staying in Japan with a good job after a Waseda MSc are favorable, provided the student engages in networking (and ideally learns some Japanese during the program for wider options).
Note: In both Japan and Korea, graduates are generally allowed and even encouraged to remain for work. Visa policies in each country have special provisions (e.g. Japan’s 恋活・就職 visa and Korea’s D-10 visa) to enable job hunting after graduation. All the programs above grant degrees that make the student eligible for skilled work visas. The key differences lie in language and industry presence: Japan has more English-friendly R&D roles in optics (especially at research institutes or international companies), whereas Korea’s private sector may expect Korean proficiency, but institutes and some corporations are becoming more open. Each listed university has support services to help international students transition to employment, making it feasible to launch a career locally upon completing the master’s program.
